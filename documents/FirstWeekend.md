# Brief Idea About What We Should Do in the First Weekend

### 1. Read the [instruction](https://cate.doc.ic.ac.uk/projects/proposals.cgi?key=2015:1:show-3463) carefully untill you totally understand it.

### 2. Read the materials of [agile methods](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rbc/302/course/) and find the best agile method. Please notice that, you should not just choose the one you like and you need to consider if it is easy to carry out and demonstrate in our report. It's better for you to find some tools help us to perform the method.

### 3. You shoud do some research about the [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). I think it is a good idea to try to deploy an Spark on your own computer. In addition, there are some open source auto deployment softwares such puppet. Although, we are not likely to use them, I think we can learn something for those softwares.

### 4. Think about the figures of benchmark and find some benchmarking systems for similar distributed systems like Hadoop.

### 5. Have your initial design and plan for the whole project.

### 6. Here are something will be used in our project: Java, Maven, Git, Markdown, REST, PostgreSQL and of course Spark. If you are not familiar with them, you should learn them as soon as possible.
