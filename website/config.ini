spark.app.name,2,The name of your application. This will appear in the UI and in log data.;
spark.driver.cores,1, Number of cores to use for the driver process, only in cluster mode.;
spark.driver.maxResultSize,1,Limit of total size of serialized results of all partitions for each Spark action (e.g. collect). Should be at least 1M, or 0 for unlimited. Jobs will be aborted if the total size is above this limit. Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from out-of-memory errors;
spark.driver.memory,1,Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where SparkContext is initialized. (e.g. 1g, 2g).;
spark.extraListeners,2,A comma-separated list of classes that implement SparkListener; when initializing SparkContext, instances of these classes will be created and registered with Spark's listener bus. If a class has a single-argument constructor that accepts a SparkConf, that constructor will be called; otherwise, a zero-argument constructor will be called. If no valid constructor can be found, the SparkContext creation will fail with an exception.;
spark.local.dir,2,Directory to use for "scratch" space in Spark, including map output files and RDDs that get stored on disk. This should be on a fast, local disk in your system. It can also be a comma-separated list of multiple directories on different disks. NOTE: In Spark 1.0 and later this will be overriden by SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS (Standalone, Mesos) or LOCAL_DIRS (YARN) environment variables set by the cluster manager.;
spark.logConf,0,Logs the effective SparkConf as INFO when a SparkContext is started.;
spark.master,2,The cluster manager to connect to. See the list of allowed master URL's.;

spark.driver.extraClassPath,2,Extra classpath entries to prepend to the classpath of the driver.;
spark.driver.extraJavaOptions,2,A string of extra JVM options to pass to the driver. For instance, GC settings or other logging.;
spark.driver.extraLibraryPath,2,Set a special library path to use when launching the driver JVM.;
spark.driver.userClassPathFirst,0,(Experimental) Whether to give user-added jars precedence over Spark's own jars when loading classes in the the driver. This feature can be used to mitigate conflicts between Spark's dependencies and user dependencies. It is currently an experimental feature. This is used in cluster mode only.;
spark.executor.extraClassPath,2,Extra classpath entries to prepend to the classpath of executors. This exists primarily for backwards-compatibility with older versions of Spark. Users typically should not need to set this option.;
spark.executor.extraJavaOptions,2,A string of extra JVM options to pass to executors. For instance, GC settings or other logging. Note that it is illegal to set Spark properties or heap size settings with this option. Spark properties should be set using a SparkConf object or the spark-defaults.conf file used with the spark-submit script. Heap size settings can be set with spark.executor.memory.;
spark.executor.extraLibraryPath,2,Set a special library path to use when launching executor JVM's.;
spark.executor.logs.rolling.maxRetainedFiles,2,Sets the number of latest rolling log files that are going to be retained by the system. Older log files will be deleted. Disabled by default.;
spark.executor.logs.rolling.maxSize,2,Set the max size of the file by which the executor logs will be rolled over. Rolling is disabled by default. See spark.executor.logs.rolling.maxRetainedFiles for automatic cleaning of old logs.;
spark.executor.logs.rolling.strategy,2,Set the strategy of rolling of executor logs. By default it is disabled. It can be set to "time" (time-based rolling) or "size" (size-based rolling). For "time", use spark.executor.logs.rolling.time.interval to set the rolling interval. For "size", use spark.executor.logs.rolling.size.maxBytes to set the maximum file size for rolling.;
spark.executor.logs.rolling.time.interval,1,Set the time interval by which the executor logs will be rolled over. Rolling is disabled by default. Valid values are `daily`, `hourly`, `minutely` or any interval in seconds. See spark.executor.logs.rolling.maxRetainedFiles for automatic cleaning of old logs.;
spark.executor.userClassPathFirst,0,(Experimental) Same functionality as spark.driver.userClassPathFirst, but applied to executor instances.;
spark.executorEnv.[EnvironmentVariableName],2,Add the environment variable specified by EnvironmentVariableName to the Executor process. The user can specify multiple of these to set multiple environment variables.;
spark.python.profile,0,Enable profiling in Python worker, the profile result will show up by `sc.show_profiles()`, or it will be displayed before the driver exiting. It also can be dumped into disk by `sc.dump_profiles(path)`. If some of the profile results had been displayed manually, they will not be displayed automatically before driver exiting. By default the `pyspark.profiler.BasicProfiler` will be used, but this can be overridden by passing a profiler class in as a parameter to the `SparkContext` constructor.;
spark.python.profile.dump,2,The directory which is used to dump the profile result before driver exiting. The results will be dumped as separated file for each RDD. They can be loaded by ptats.Stats(). If this is specified, the profile result will not be displayed automatically.;
spark.python.worker.memory,1,Amount of memory to use per python worker process during aggregation, in the same format as JVM memory strings (e.g. 512m, 2g). If the memory used during aggregation goes above this amount, it will spill the data into disks.;
spark.python.worker.reuse,0,Reuse Python worker or not. If yes, it will use a fixed number of Python workers, does not need to fork() a Python process for every tasks. It will be very useful if there is large broadcast, then the broadcast will not be needed to transfered from JVM to Python worker for every task.;

spark.reducer.maxSizeInFlight,1,Maximum size of map outputs to fetch simultaneously from each reduce task. Since each output requires us to create a buffer to receive it, this represents a fixed memory overhead per reduce task, so keep it small unless you have a large amount of memory.;
spark.shuffle.blockTransferService,2,Implementation to use for transferring shuffle and cached blocks between executors. There are two implementations available: netty and nio. Netty-based block transfer is intended to be simpler but equally efficient and is the default option starting in 1.2, and nio block transfer is deprecated in Spark 1.5.0 and will be removed in Spark 1.6.0.;
spark.shuffle.compress,0,Whether to compress map output files. Generally a good idea. Compression will use spark.io.compression.codec.;
spark.shuffle.consolidateFiles,0,If set to "true", consolidates intermediate files created during a shuffle. Creating fewer files can improve filesystem performance for shuffles with large numbers of reduce tasks. It is recommended to set this to "true" when using ext4 or xfs filesystems. On ext3, this option might degrade performance on machines with many (>8) cores due to filesystem limitations.;
spark.shuffle.file.buffer,1,Size of the in-memory buffer for each shuffle file output stream. These buffers reduce the number of disk seeks and system calls made in creating intermediate shuffle files.;
spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries,3,(Netty only) Fetches that fail due to IO-related exceptions are automatically retried if this is set to a non-zero value. This retry logic helps stabilize large shuffles in the face of long GC pauses or transient network connectivity issues.;
spark.shuffle.io.numConnectionsPerPeer,1,(Netty only) Connections between hosts are reused in order to reduce connection buildup for large clusters. For clusters with many hard disks and few hosts, this may result in insufficient concurrency to saturate all disks, and so users may consider increasing this value.;
spark.shuffle.io.preferDirectBufs,0,(Netty only) Off-heap buffers are used to reduce garbage collection during shuffle and cache block transfer. For environments where off-heap memory is tightly limited, users may wish to turn this off to force all allocations from Netty to be on-heap.;
spark.shuffle.io.retryWait,1,(Netty only) How long to wait between retries of fetches. The maximum delay caused by retrying is 15 seconds by default, calculated as maxRetries * retryWait.;
spark.shuffle.manager,2,Implementation to use for shuffling data. There are three implementations available: sort, hash and the new (1.5+) tungsten-sort. Sort-based shuffle is more memory-efficient and is the default option starting in 1.2. Tungsten-sort is similar to the sort based shuffle, with a direct binary cache-friendly implementation with a fall back to regular sort based shuffle if its requirements are not met.;
spark.shuffle.memoryFraction,1,Fraction of Java heap to use for aggregation and cogroups during shuffles, if spark.shuffle.spill is true. At any given time, the collective size of all in-memory maps used for shuffles is bounded by this limit, beyond which the contents will begin to spill to disk. If spills are often, consider increasing this value at the expense of spark.storage.memoryFraction.;
spark.shuffle.service.enabled,0,Enables the external shuffle service. This service preserves the shuffle files written by executors so the executors can be safely removed. This must be enabled if spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled is "true". The external shuffle service must be set up in order to enable it. See dynamic allocation configuration and setup documentation for more information.;
spark.shuffle.service.port,1,Port on which the external shuffle service will run.;
spark.shuffle.sort.bypassMergeThreshold,1,(Advanced) In the sort-based shuffle manager, avoid merge-sorting data if there is no map-side aggregation and there are at most this many reduce partitions.;
spark.shuffle.spill,0,If set to "true", limits the amount of memory used during reduces by spilling data out to disk. This spilling threshold is specified by spark.shuffle.memoryFraction.;
spark.shuffle.spill.compress,0,Whether to compress data spilled during shuffles. Compression will use spark.io.compression.codec.;

spark.eventLog.compress,0,Whether to compress logged events, if spark.eventLog.enabled is true.;
spark.eventLog.dir,2,Base directory in which Spark events are logged, if spark.eventLog.enabled is true. Within this base directory, Spark creates a sub-directory for each application, and logs the events specific to the application in this directory. Users may want to set this to a unified location like an HDFS directory so history files can be read by the history server.;
spark.eventLog.enabled,0,Whether to log Spark events, useful for reconstructing the Web UI after the application has finished.;
spark.ui.killEnabled,0,Allows stages and corresponding jobs to be killed from the web ui.;
spark.ui.port,1,Port for your application's dashboard, which shows memory and workload data.;
spark.ui.retainedJobs,1,How many jobs the Spark UI and status APIs remember before garbage collecting.;
spark.ui.retainedStages,1,How many stages the Spark UI and status APIs remember before garbage collecting.;
spark.worker.ui.retainedExecutors,1,How many finished executors the Spark UI and status APIs remember before garbage collecting.;
spark.worker.ui.retainedDrivers,1,How many finished drivers the Spark UI and status APIs remember before garbage collecting.;
spark.sql.ui.retainedExecutions,1,How many finished executions the Spark UI and status APIs remember before garbage collecting.;
spark.streaming.ui.retainedBatches,1,How many finished batches the Spark UI and status APIs remember before garbage collecting.;

spark.broadcast.compress,0,Whether to compress broadcast variables before sending them. Generally a good idea.;
spark.closure.serializer,2,Serializer class to use for closures. Currently only the Java serializer is supported.;
spark.io.compression.codec,2,The codec used to compress internal data such as RDD partitions, broadcast variables and shuffle outputs. By default, Spark provides three codecs: lz4, lzf, and snappy. You can also use fully qualified class names to specify the codec, e.g. org.apache.spark.io.LZ4CompressionCodec, org.apache.spark.io.LZFCompressionCodec, and org.apache.spark.io.SnappyCompressionCodec.;
spark.io.compression.lz4.blockSize,1,Block size used in LZ4 compression, in the case when LZ4 compression codec is used. Lowering this block size will also lower shuffle memory usage when LZ4 is used.;
spark.io.compression.snappy.blockSize,1,Block size used in Snappy compression, in the case when Snappy compression codec is used. Lowering this block size will also lower shuffle memory usage when Snappy is used.;
spark.kryo.classesToRegister,2,If you use Kryo serialization, give a comma-separated list of custom class names to register with Kryo. See the tuning guide for more details.;
spark.kryo.referenceTracking,0,Whether to track references to the same object when serializing data with Kryo, which is necessary if your object graphs have loops and useful for efficiency if they contain multiple copies of the same object. Can be disabled to improve performance if you know this is not the case.;
spark.kryo.registrationRequired,0,Whether to require registration with Kryo. If set to 'true', Kryo will throw an exception if an unregistered class is serialized. If set to false (the default), Kryo will write unregistered class names along with each object. Writing class names can cause significant performance overhead, so enabling this option can enforce strictly that a user has not omitted classes from registration.;
spark.kryo.registrator,2,If you use Kryo serialization, set this class to register your custom classes with Kryo. This property is useful if you need to register your classes in a custom way, e.g. to specify a custom field serializer. Otherwise spark.kryo.classesToRegister is simpler. It should be set to a class that extends KryoRegistrator. See the tuning guide for more details.;
spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max,1,Maximum allowable size of Kryo serialization buffer. This must be larger than any object you attempt to serialize. Increase this if you get a "buffer limit exceeded" exception inside Kryo.;
spark.kryoserializer.buffer,1,Initial size of Kryo's serialization buffer. Note that there will be one buffer per core on each worker. This buffer will grow up to spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max if needed.;
spark.rdd.compress,0,Whether to compress serialized RDD partitions (e.g. for StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY_SER). Can save substantial space at the cost of some extra CPU time.;
spark.serializer,2,Class to use for serializing objects that will be sent over the network or need to be cached in serialized form. The default of Java serialization works with any Serializable Java object but is quite slow, so we recommend using org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer and configuring Kryo serialization when speed is necessary. Can be any subclass of org.apache.spark.Serializer.;
spark.serializer.objectStreamReset,1,When serializing using org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializer, the serializer caches objects to prevent writing redundant data, however that stops garbage collection of those objects. By calling 'reset' you flush that info from the serializer, and allow old objects to be collected. To turn off this periodic reset set it to -1. By default it will reset the serializer every 100 objects.;

spark.broadcast.blockSize,1,Size of each piece of a block for TorrentBroadcastFactory. Too large a value decreases parallelism during broadcast (makes it slower); however, if it is too small, BlockManager might take a performance hit.;
spark.broadcast.factory,2,Which broadcast implementation to use.;
spark.cleaner.ttl,2,Duration (seconds) of how long Spark will remember any metadata (stages generated, tasks generated, etc.). Periodic cleanups will ensure that metadata older than this duration will be forgotten. This is useful for running Spark for many hours / days (for example, running 24/7 in case of Spark Streaming applications). Note that any RDD that persists in memory for more than this duration will be cleared as well.;
spark.executor.cores,1,The number of cores to use on each executor. For YARN and standalone mode only. In standalone mode, setting this parameter allows an application to run multiple executors on the same worker, provided that there are enough cores on that worker. Otherwise, only one executor per application will run on each worker.;
spark.default.parallelism,1,Default number of partitions in RDDs returned by transformations like join, reduceByKey, and parallelize when not set by user.;
spark.executor.heartbeatInterval,1,Interval between each executor's heartbeats to the driver. Heartbeats let the driver know that the executor is still alive and update it with metrics for in-progress tasks.;
spark.files.fetchTimeout,1,Communication timeout to use when fetching files added through SparkContext.addFile() from the driver.;
spark.files.useFetchCache,1,If set to true (default), file fetching will use a local cache that is shared by executors that belong to the same application, which can improve task launching performance when running many executors on the same host. If set to false, these caching optimizations will be disabled and all executors will fetch their own copies of files. This optimization may be disabled in order to use Spark local directories that reside on NFS filesystems (see SPARK-6313 for more details).;
spark.files.overwrite,1,Whether to overwrite files added through SparkContext.addFile() when the target file exists and its contents do not match those of the source.;
spark.hadoop.cloneConf,1,If set to true, clones a new Hadoop Configuration object for each task. This option should be enabled to work around Configuration thread-safety issues (see SPARK-2546 for more details). This is disabled by default in order to avoid unexpected performance regressions for jobs that are not affected by these issues.;
spark.hadoop.validateOutputSpecs,1,If set to true, validates the output specification (e.g. checking if the output directory already exists) used in saveAsHadoopFile and other variants. This can be disabled to silence exceptions due to pre-existing output directories. We recommend that users do not disable this except if trying to achieve compatibility with previous versions of Spark. Simply use Hadoop's FileSystem API to delete output directories by hand. This setting is ignored for jobs generated through Spark Streaming's StreamingContext, since data may need to be rewritten to pre-existing output directories during checkpoint recovery.;
spark.storage.memoryFraction,1,Fraction of Java heap to use for Spark's memory cache. This should not be larger than the "old" generation of objects in the JVM, which by default is given 0.6 of the heap, but you can increase it if you configure your own old generation size.;
spark.storage.memoryMapThreshold,1,Size of a block above which Spark memory maps when reading a block from disk. This prevents Spark from memory mapping very small blocks. In general, memory mapping has high overhead for blocks close to or below the page size of the operating system.;
spark.storage.unrollFraction,1,Fraction of spark.storage.memoryFraction to use for unrolling blocks in memory. This is dynamically allocated by dropping existing blocks when there is not enough free storage space to unroll the new block in its entirety.;
spark.externalBlockStore.blockManager,2,Implementation of external block manager (file system) that store RDDs. The file system's URL is set by spark.externalBlockStore.url.;
spark.externalBlockStore.baseDir,2,Directories of the external block store that store RDDs. The file system's URL is set by spark.externalBlockStore.url It can also be a comma-separated list of multiple directories on Tachyon file system.;
spark.externalBlockStore.url,2,The URL of the underlying external blocker file system in the external block store.;

spark.akka.frameSize,1,Maximum message size to allow in "control plane" communication; generally only applies to map output size information sent between executors and the driver. Increase this if you are running jobs with many thousands of map and reduce tasks and see messages about the frame size.;
spark.akka.heartbeat.interval,1,This is set to a larger value to disable the transport failure detector that comes built in to Akka. It can be enabled again, if you plan to use this feature (Not recommended). A larger interval value reduces network overhead and a smaller value ( ~ 1 s) might be more informative for Akka's failure detector. Tune this in combination of `spark.akka.heartbeat.pauses` if you need to. A likely positive use case for using failure detector would be: a sensistive failure detector can help evict rogue executors quickly. However this is usually not the case as GC pauses and network lags are expected in a real Spark cluster. Apart from that enabling this leads to a lot of exchanges of heart beats between nodes leading to flooding the network with those.;
spark.akka.heartbeat.pauses,1,This is set to a larger value to disable the transport failure detector that comes built in to Akka. It can be enabled again, if you plan to use this feature (Not recommended). Acceptable heart beat pause for Akka. This can be used to control sensitivity to GC pauses. Tune this along with `spark.akka.heartbeat.interval` if you need to.;
spark.akka.threads,1,Number of actor threads to use for communication. Can be useful to increase on large clusters when the driver has a lot of CPU cores.;
spark.akka.timeout,1,Communication timeout between Spark nodes.;
spark.blockManager.port,1,Port for all block managers to listen on. These exist on both the driver and the executors.;
spark.broadcast.port,1,Port for the driver's HTTP broadcast server to listen on. This is not relevant for torrent broadcast.;
spark.driver.host,2,Hostname or IP address for the driver to listen on. This is used for communicating with the executors and the standalone Master.;
spark.driver.port,1,Port for the driver to listen on. This is used for communicating with the executors and the standalone Master.;
spark.executor.port,1,Port for the executor to listen on. This is used for communicating with the driver.;
spark.fileserver.port,1,Port for the driver's HTTP file server to listen on.;
spark.network.timeout,1,Default timeout for all network interactions. This config will be used in place of spark.core.connection.ack.wait.timeout, spark.akka.timeout, spark.storage.blockManagerSlaveTimeoutMs, spark.shuffle.io.connectionTimeout, spark.rpc.askTimeout or spark.rpc.lookupTimeout if they are not configured.;
spark.port.maxRetries,1,Default maximum number of retries when binding to a port before giving up.;
spark.replClassServer.port,1,Port for the driver's HTTP class server to listen on. This is only relevant for the Spark shell.;
spark.rpc.numRetries,1,Number of times to retry before an RPC task gives up. An RPC task will run at most times of this number.;
spark.rpc.retry.wait,1,Duration for an RPC ask operation to wait before retrying.;
spark.rpc.askTimeout,1,Duration for an RPC ask operation to wait before timing out.;
spark.rpc.lookupTimeout,1,Duration for an RPC remote endpoint lookup operation to wait before timing out.
;

spark.cores.max,2,When running on a standalone deploy cluster or a Mesos cluster in "coarse-grained" sharing mode, the maximum amount of CPU cores to request for the application from across the cluster (not from each machine). If not set, the default will be spark.deploy.defaultCores on Spark's standalone cluster manager, or infinite (all available cores) on Mesos.;
spark.locality.wait,2,How long to wait to launch a data-local task before giving up and launching it on a less-local node. The same wait will be used to step through multiple locality levels (process-local, node-local, rack-local and then any). It is also possible to customize the waiting time for each level by setting spark.locality.wait.node, etc. You should increase this setting if your tasks are long and see poor locality, but the default usually works well.;
spark.locality.wait.node,2,Customize the locality wait for node locality. For example, you can set this to 0 to skip node locality and search immediately for rack locality (if your cluster has rack information).;
spark.locality.wait.process,2,Customize the locality wait for process locality. This affects tasks that attempt to access cached data in a particular executor process.;
spark.locality.wait.rack,2,Customize the locality wait for rack locality.;
spark.scheduler.maxRegisteredResourcesWaitingTime,1,Maximum amount of time to wait for resources to register before scheduling begins.;
spark.scheduler.minRegisteredResourcesRatio,1,The minimum ratio of registered resources (registered resources / total expected resources) (resources are executors in yarn mode, CPU cores in standalone mode) to wait for before scheduling begins. Specified as a double between 0.0 and 1.0. Regardless of whether the minimum ratio of resources has been reached, the maximum amount of time it will wait before scheduling begins is controlled by config spark.scheduler.maxRegisteredResourcesWaitingTime.;
spark.scheduler.mode,2,The scheduling mode between jobs submitted to the same SparkContext. Can be set to FAIR to use fair sharing instead of queueing jobs one after another. Useful for multi-user services.;
spark.scheduler.revive.interval,1,The interval length for the scheduler to revive the worker resource offers to run tasks.;
spark.speculation,0,If set to "true", performs speculative execution of tasks. This means if one or more tasks are running slowly in a stage, they will be re-launched.;
spark.speculation.interval,1,How often Spark will check for tasks to speculate.;
spark.speculation.multiplier,1,How many times slower a task is than the median to be considered for speculation.;
spark.speculation.quantile,1,Percentage of tasks which must be complete before speculation is enabled for a particular stage.;
spark.task.cpus,1,Number of cores to allocate for each task.;
spark.task.maxFailures,1,Number of individual task failures before giving up on the job. Should be greater than or equal to 1. Number of allowed retries = this value - 1.;

spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled,0,Whether to use dynamic resource allocation, which scales the number of executors registered with this application up and down based on the workload. Note that this is currently only available on YARN mode. For more detail, see the description here. ;
spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout,1,If dynamic allocation is enabled and an executor has been idle for more than this duration, the executor will be removed. For more detail, see this description.;
spark.dynamicAllocation.cachedExecutorIdleTimeout,2,If dynamic allocation is enabled and an executor which has cached data blocks has been idle for more than this duration, the executor will be removed. For more details, see this description.;
spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors,2,Initial number of executors to run if dynamic allocation is enabled.;
spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors,2,Upper bound for the number of executors if dynamic allocation is enabled.;
spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors,0,Lower bound for the number of executors if dynamic allocation is enabled.;
spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout,1,If dynamic allocation is enabled and there have been pending tasks backlogged for more than this duration, new executors will be requested. For more detail, see this description.;
spark.dynamicAllocation.sustainedSchedulerBacklogTimeout,2,Same as spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout, but used only for subsequent executor requests. For more detail, see this description.;

spark.acls.enable,0,Whether Spark acls should are enabled. If enabled, this checks to see if the user has access permissions to view or modify the job. Note this requires the user to be known, so if the user comes across as null no checks are done. Filters can be used with the UI to authenticate and set the user.;
spark.admin.acls,Empty,Comma separated list of users/administrators that have view and modify access to all Spark jobs. This can be used if you run on a shared cluster and have a set of administrators or devs who help debug when things work.;
spark.authenticate,0,Whether Spark authenticates its internal connections. See spark.authenticate.secret if not running on YARN.;
spark.authenticate.secret,2,Set the secret key used for Spark to authenticate between components. This needs to be set if not running on YARN and authentication is enabled.;
spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption,0,Enable encrypted communication when authentication is enabled. This option is currently only supported by the block transfer service.;
spark.network.sasl.serverAlwaysEncrypt,0,Disable unencrypted connections for services that support SASL authentication. This is currently supported by the external shuffle service.;
spark.core.connection.ack.wait.timeout,1,How long for the connection to wait for ack to occur before timing out and giving up. To avoid unwilling timeout caused by long pause like GC, you can set larger value.;
spark.core.connection.auth.wait.timeout,1,How long for the connection to wait for authentication to occur before timing out and giving up.;
spark.modify.acls,2,Comma separated list of users that have modify access to the Spark job. By default only the user that started the Spark job has access to modify it (kill it for example).;
spark.ui.filters,2,Comma separated list of filter class names to apply to the Spark web UI. The filter should be a standard javax servlet Filter. ;
spark.ui.view.acls,2,Comma separated list of users that have view access to the Spark web ui. By default only the user that started the Spark job has view access.;

spark.ssl.enabled,0,All the SSL settings like spark.ssl.xxx where xxx is a particular configuration property, denote the global configuration for all the supported protocols. In order to override the global configuration for the particular protocol, the properties must be overwritten in the protocol-specific namespace.;
spark.ssl.enabledAlgorithms,2,A comma separated list of ciphers. The specified ciphers must be supported by JVM. The reference list of protocols one can find on this page.;
spark.ssl.keyPassword,2,A password to the private key in key-store.;
spark.ssl.keyStore,2,A path to a key-store file. The path can be absolute or relative to the directory where the component is started in.;
spark.ssl.keyStorePassword,2,A password to the key-store.;
spark.ssl.protocol,2,A protocol name. The protocol must be supported by JVM. The reference list of protocols one can find on this page.;
spark.ssl.trustStore,2,A path to a trust-store file. The path can be absolute or relative to the directory where the component is started in.;
spark.ssl.trustStorePassword,2,A password to the trust-store.;

spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled,0,Enables or disables Spark Streaming's internal backpressure mechanism (since 1.5). This enables the Spark Streaming to control the receiving rate based on the current batch scheduling delays and processing times so that the system receives only as fast as the system can process. Internally, this dynamically sets the maximum receiving rate of receivers. This rate is upper bounded by the values `spark.streaming.receiver.maxRate` and `spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition` if they are set (see below).;
spark.streaming.blockInterval,1,Interval at which data received by Spark Streaming receivers is chunked into blocks of data before storing them in Spark. Minimum recommended - 50 ms. See the performance tuning section in the Spark Streaming programing guide for more details.;
spark.streaming.receiver.maxRate,1,Maximum rate (number of records per second) at which each receiver will receive data. Effectively, each stream will consume at most this number of records per second. Setting this configuration to 0 or a negative number will put no limit on the rate. See the deployment guide in the Spark Streaming programing guide for mode details.;
spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable,0,Enable write ahead logs for receivers. All the input data received through receivers will be saved to write ahead logs that will allow it to be recovered after driver failures. See the deployment guide in the Spark Streaming programing guide for more details.;
spark.streaming.unpersist,0,Force RDDs generated and persisted by Spark Streaming to be automatically unpersisted from Spark's memory. The raw input data received by Spark Streaming is also automatically cleared. Setting this to false will allow the raw data and persisted RDDs to be accessible outside the streaming application as they will not be cleared automatically. But it comes at the cost of higher memory usage in Spark.;
spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition,1,Maximum rate (number of records per second) at which data will be read from each Kafka partition when using the new Kafka direct stream API. See the Kafka Integration guide for more details.;
spark.streaming.kafka.maxRetries,1,Maximum number of consecutive retries the driver will make in order to find the latest offsets on the leader of each partition (a default value of 1 means that the driver will make a maximum of 2 attempts). Only applies to the new Kafka direct stream API.;
spark.streaming.ui.retainedBatches,1,How many batches the Spark Streaming UI and status APIs remember before garbage collecting.;

spark.r.numRBackendThreads,2,Number of threads used by RBackend to handle RPC calls from SparkR package.;
spark.r.command,2,Executable for executing R scripts in cluster modes for both driver and workers.;
spark.r.driver.command,2,Executable for executing R scripts in client modes for driver. Ignored in cluster modes.;
